# RPNQA
Representation of Questions and Answers using Reverse Polish Notation

### Collective Intelligence

3 ideas: RPN, QA, Delegation

We propose a model of collective intelligence involving human and machine based on delegation, question and answer, and reverse Polish notation.

Delegation and Q&A are conventional. RPN applied to Q&A is novel. Although RPN has a long history, the breakthrough occurred when we successful implemented a generalized inverse of the shunting yard algorithm. As such, we are now able to implement shells executing Forth like RPN commands in any known host programming language. Further, since RPN can be used to represent fundamental mathematical structures, we now have established a practical method to unify all programming languages and mathematics, enabling us to use RPN to represent questions and answers from the lowest and the most fundamental levels to the highest and most abstract levels.

To illustrate ....

Ever since the term artificial intelligence was coined at the Dartmouth College conference, it has suffered from fragmentation of discipline and methods. 

Curiously, the solution that we propose actually dates back to the same era of Dartmouth, but was overlooked due to ....


RPN and QA are two areas in machine and human cognition that can unify methods in machine and human cognition respectively. RPN is bottom up, includes code and mathematics. QA is top down, with black boxes. Question is if these black boxes can be filled with RPN? Note, even human beings are mostly good at delegation -- until found experts who can do it, not really intelligent!!

Delegation vs. intelligence? Perhaps we are shooting for wrong targets by insisting machine that can do everything! Because human cannot!

Elaborate collective intelligence as upper limit of machine intelligence. Else conventional AI expects too much of AI.






Although we do not know the detailed neural mechanisms of ourselves getting an answer for a question, we are able to express both question and answer as text or graphics. Using RPN, we can simulate the mechanisms to associate the question and answer, as they are explicitly representable as text and graphics.


We propose a model ... based on RPN and Q&A ... with a realistic and verifiable timeline to achieve human level artificial intelligence (HLAI). Breakthrough is in homoiconicity and the mechanism to create rules from rules.

Categories of Question and Answer Pair:

0 degree: Most are direct table look up.

First degree: Others are goal feedback. Maps. Inverse kinematics. Chess. Fixed rules.

Second degree: What else? Mathematical equations? Same level GOEHDOM. No rules. Make composite rule from rules. Requires homoiconicity.

Ideas in text are well defined in text. But we still need toUse RPN to define the degrees and ideas above in machine executable format.
