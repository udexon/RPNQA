Representation of Questions and Answers using Reverse Polish Notation

Question and Answer representation using Reverse Polish Notation

Although we do not know the detailed neural mechanisms of ourselves getting an answer for a question, we are able to express both question and answer as text or graphics. Using RPN, we can simulate the mechanisms to associate the question and answer, as they are explicitly representable as text and graphics.

Categories of Question and Answer Pair:

0 degree: Most are direct table look up.

First degree: Others are goal feedback. Maps. Inverse kinematics. Chess. Fixed rules.

Second degree: What else? Mathematical equations? Same level GOEHDOM. No rules. Make composite rule from rules. Requires homoiconicity.

Ideas in text are well defined in text. But we still need toUse RPN to define the degrees and ideas above in machine executable format.
